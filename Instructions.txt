LAB DESCRIPTION
=================
In this lab, you will use Node to create simple endpoints
for handling GET requests using the core HTTP module. You
will use Node to send back plain text responses, responses
that are based on an included module and JSON responses.

It's important to note that you should NOT get too comfortable
with creating endpoints using this method as this is what
the Express module is for. This is the first and last time you
will create endpoints using this method! This lab is to just get
you familiar with Node, modules, endpoints and the request/response cycle.

INSTRUCTIONS
============
1. Fork this project to your REPL.it account

2. Follow the instructions included as comments beginning on Part 1
   in the index.js file. After you get Part 1 working, the client
   index.html page will load and you will be presented with Parts 2-5.
   Expect to jump from the client (index.html) to the server (index.js)
   for each part. Start by creating the endpoint handlers first (index.js),
   test them using a testing tool such as req bin, then add the client
   code that consumes the particular API. This will significantly
   reduce your debugging time.
